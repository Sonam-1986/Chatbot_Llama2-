#ðŸ¦™ðŸ’¬ LLaMA LangChain Chatbot-
A conversational AI powered by Metaâ€™s LLaMA and the LangChain framework


# ðŸ“– Overview -

1. This project is an intelligent, context-aware chatbot that leverages:

2. LLaMA as the large language model backbone

3. LangChain for orchestration, memory, and tool integration

4. Custom prompt engineering for tailored responses

5. Vector databases for long-term memory & semantic search

6. Streaming chat with real-time typing simulation

7. The bot can remember previous messages in the conversation, access external tools, and give human-like, coherent answers.

# âœ¨ Features-

1. Multi-turn conversation with context retention

2. Tool-augmented reasoning (web search, document retrieval, API calls)

3. Embeddings-based memory with vector stores like Pinecone, FAISS, or Chroma

4. Customizable personality through prompt templates

5. Extensible architecture for adding new tools or data sources

# ðŸ“š How It Works -

1. User input â†’ sent to LangChainâ€™s ConversationChain

2. LLaMA model generates a response using memory + prompt template

3. Memory store saves embeddings for context continuity

4. Optional: Tool calls (search, database lookup) for enhanced answers

# ðŸ“œ Roadmap -

 1. Support for multiple personas

 2. Fine-tuning LLaMA for domain-specific use cases

 3. Voice input/output integration

 4. Multi-user chat sessions
